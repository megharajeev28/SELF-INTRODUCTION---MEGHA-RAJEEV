# SELF-INTRODUCTION---MEGHA-RAJEEV

Hello! I’m Megha Rajeev, currently pursuing my Integrated M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at VIT Bhopal .
I am an AI-driven software engineer who loves turning complex data into real-world solutions.
My core expertise lies in Python, Java, and C++. I’ve built a strong foundation in Machine Learning, NLP, and Deep Learning, while also staying proficient in full-stack tools like React.js and FastAPI. 
I enjoy working across the entire lifecycle of a product—from designing smart backend architectures to deploying on AWS."
I’ve applied these skills in projects like TrendMoni, where I built an AI agent using LangChain for real-time trend detection, and Sensi-Talk, a multi-modal system that uses computer vision to help bridge communication gaps. Being a contributor to the Darzi AI suite also gave me deep insights into building production-ready LLM workflows.
What sets me apart is my ability to blend core engineering principles with emerging AI technologies. I’m a quick learner, a collaborative team player, and I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects. 
Thank you for your time!
